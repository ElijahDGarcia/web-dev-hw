        <p>Brian Jacques was an English writer, known for his Redwall series of
          novels. He's written hundreds of poems, though they're contained in
          his books as character poems rather than in a single collection of his
          own writings.</p>

          <p>An example of his writing can be found <a href="./index.html"

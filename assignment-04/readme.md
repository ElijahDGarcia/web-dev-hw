#Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?
I went to Myspace, the old social media networking site everybody used before Facebook. It was interesting, and nostalgic, to look back at the old login page.
No music, no ads, nothing like that, it reminded me of Facebook. Now the website is primarily used by musical artists rather than everyday people.
#Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?
It's an easy way to upload work and see it online, I'm glad github implemented their  .io live sites so I don't have to keep opening HTML files on local servers.

#Include your screenshot as an image link.

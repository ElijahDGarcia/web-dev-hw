#How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?
Each document can only have one <head> and one <body> element. The head element can't be seen by the viewer, and is there usually to help search engines, browsers, and other developers understand what the page is really about. It talks to a higher level, not a consumer level. The body element contains everything a random person visiting your site will see.
#Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
Structural markup is the physical makeup of the site, in terms of where things are positioned and in what order. Semantic changes how things are displayed.

#Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Considering I can't cook stuff on-campus, I had to take a recipe and picture from a book I got from Blizzcon.
It's a drink-mixing book, but it's the best I had. I put all the text in the editor first, and then put all the markings around it first.
For example, I typed out all the lists and the definitions first, then went in after and applied all the elements and attributes, etc.
I thought it would be faster than doing them all individually.
I also did the whole thing without testing it in browser once, but pushing changes and checking the browser with every section would be too tedious.

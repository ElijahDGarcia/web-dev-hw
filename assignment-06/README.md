# Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
There aren't many forms in the modern era of the Internet, except for comment sections. (And those are usually using some third party software like Discus).
Back in the day, almost every website had stuff like guestbooks or suggestion boxes or contact forms. Nowadays companies would rather you send emails than
send text via a website.

# List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
Text input: Comments, suggestions, guestbooks, used on websites to gather feedback.
Selection: Dates, times, pizza toppings: eatstreet.com uses selection inputs to list ingredients I can put on my order.
Button input: Usually used to activate some script on the page.

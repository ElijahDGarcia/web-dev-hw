# Briefly describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
Universal selects all. Use for stuff like pages where fonts don't change.
Element is for stuff like headers, paragraphs, etc. Use for general changes if you want the page to have a unified look.
Class is for more intricate and specific changes, for changing blocks of content.
ID is the most specific, for changing specific headings and blocks that are special in their own right.
# Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes
I use green, white, and black, as they were the most-common colors used in old BIOS and command prompt interfaces.
black value: black
white value: hite
green hex:#48FF78
# Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Lots of googling "CSS X" with X being whatever I needed help with.
I wrote out the html document first, then started going to work in css
had a local hosted version of the website I could use to test changes.

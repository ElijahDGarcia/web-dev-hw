# Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned a lot about navigating between webpages. I never knew how to go from page to page from the sites themselves, and ended up always manually inputting the URLS of each page of my website. Dropdowns and navbars
made webdev really, really easy, considering it was so easy for me to test all my pages live. I didn't learn anything new about github, but I did come to rely on just how useful it was on multiple computers. (Laptop to PC to library)
# Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I didn't know about inbedding stuff like songs or maps, and that adds a lot of stuff into my website making. I also didn't know how to import fonts from the web without downloading them to my PC. I learned now, though.
# Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I spent a lot of time on W3schools. The fact that that website exists made this a lot easier. I tried getting into webdev years ago using books, but w3schools made any questions disappear with little to no effort.
I also spent a lot of time copy/pasting code from my older assignments to this one, saving a lot of time.

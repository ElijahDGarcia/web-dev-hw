  <h1 class="mainheader">Welcome to my Website!</h1>
  <p class="mainpara">This is the final project for my Web Design course! This
  is where I'll demonstrate all of the skills I've learned over the course
  of the semester, including navbars, images, alt text, and so much more!
  I'm also going to be trying new things, too.</p>

    My main interests are in things like graphic design, UX/UI, and more artsy
    stuff like animation! I'm hoping to eventually get a job in the tech industry,
    while maintaining my residence in Montana. Telecommuting gives me the Big City
    wage with the Small Town cost of living!</p>

    This class has been the most stressful out of all my classes, but I think
    it's also turned out to be the most useful. I learned things I can apply right
    now to wordpress sites I write for, and I feel like these foundations will
    even allow me to start freelancing!</p>
